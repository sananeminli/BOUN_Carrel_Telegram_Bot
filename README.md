# Telegram bot for getting live carrel data

This telegram bot is a personal project of mine.

This bot's main functionality is getting all carrel data from the library's website and returning the data according to some features.

For scraping data from the website, the BeautifulSoup library has been used.

Users can interact with that bot by using the following telegram chat link https://t.me/BOUN_Carrel_bot.

Users can see available commands in the telegram command menu, or users can type /help in the bot and check all possible commands.
